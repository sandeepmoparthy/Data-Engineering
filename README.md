# Data-Engineering
DE ETE

## Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end data engineering solution using AWS services. The solution includes data ingestion, storage, processing, and visualization. The primary AWS services used in this project are AWS S3, AWS Glue, AWS Lambda, AWS Step Functions, Amazon RDS, and Amazon QuickSight.

## Architecture

## Components

1. **Data Ingestion**
   - **AWS S3**: Used for storing raw data files.
   - **AWS Lambda**: Functions to trigger data ingestion and processing workflows.

2. **Data Storage**
   - **AWS S3**: Raw and processed data storage.
   - **Amazon RDS**: Relational database for structured data storage.

3. **Data Processing**
   - **AWS Glue**: ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) jobs to process and transform data.
   - **AWS Step Functions**: Orchestrates the workflow of data processing tasks.

4. **Data Visualization**
   - **Amazon QuickSight**: Business intelligence and data visualization.

## Prerequisites

- AWS Account
- AWS CLI configured
- IAM roles with necessary permissions
- S3 buckets for raw and processed data
- Amazon RDS instance
- Amazon QuickSight account

## Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/aws-data-engineering-solution.git
   cd aws-data-engineering-solution
   ```

2. **Create S3 Buckets**
   ```bash
   aws s3 mb s3://your-raw-data-bucket
   aws s3 mb s3://your-processed-data-bucket
   ```

3. **Deploy AWS Lambda Functions**
   - Navigate to the `lambda` directory and deploy the functions using AWS CLI or AWS Management Console.

4. **Configure AWS Glue**
   - Create AWS Glue crawlers and jobs to process the data.
   - Define the ETL scripts and schedule the jobs.

5. **Set Up Amazon RDS**
   - Create an RDS instance and configure the database schema.
   - Load initial data into the RDS instance.

6. **Orchestrate with AWS Step Functions**
   - Define the state machine to orchestrate the data processing workflow.
   - Deploy the state machine using AWS CLI or AWS Management Console.

7. **Visualize Data with Amazon QuickSight**
   - Connect Amazon QuickSight to the RDS instance.
   - Create dashboards and visualizations to analyze the processed data.

## Usage

1. **Ingest Data**
   - Upload raw data files to the S3 bucket.
   - AWS Lambda functions will trigger the data processing workflow.

2. **Process Data**
   - AWS Glue jobs will extract, transform, and load the data into the RDS instance.

3. **Visualize Data**
   - Use Amazon QuickSight to create and view dashboards based on the processed data.
