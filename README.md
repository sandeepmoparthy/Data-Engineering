# Data-Engineering
DE ETE

## Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end data engineering solution using AWS services. The solution includes data ingestion, storage, processing, and visualization. The primary AWS services used in this project are AWS S3, AWS Glue, AWS Lambda, AWS Step Functions, Amazon RDS, and Amazon QuickSight.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

KPIs are essential to measure and monitor the efficiency, timeliness, and accuracy of the shipment processes.

### 1. Shipment KPIs

- **On-Time Delivery Rate**: Percentage of shipments delivered on or before the promised delivery date.
  - **Formula**: 
    $$
    \frac{\text{On-Time Deliveries}}{\text{Total Shipments}} \times 100
    $$

- **Average Delivery Time**: The average time taken from shipment dispatch to delivery.
  - **Formula**: 
    $$
    \frac{\sum \text{Delivery Times}}{\text{Total Shipments}}
    $$

- **Shipment Delay Rate**: Percentage of shipments delayed past the estimated delivery date.
  - **Formula**: 
    $$
    \frac{\text{Delayed Shipments}}{\text{Total Shipments}} \times 100
    $$

- **Order Processing Time**: Average time taken from order placement to shipment dispatch.

- **Fulfillment Rate**: Percentage of orders fulfilled successfully out of total orders placed.
  - **Formula**: 
    $$
    \frac{\text{Successful Fulfillments}}{\text{Total Orders}} \times 100
    $$

- **Percentage of Lost or Damaged Shipments**: Number of shipments reported as lost or damaged in transit.

### 2. Customer Satisfaction KPIs

- **Customer Satisfaction Score (CSAT)**: Percentage of satisfied customers based on post-delivery surveys.

- **Net Promoter Score (NPS)**: Measures customer loyalty and likelihood of recommending the service.

- **Customer Complaints Rate**: Number of complaints related to shipment issues (e.g., delays, damages).

### 3. Operational Efficiency KPIs

- **Average Cost per Shipment**: Average cost incurred per shipment, including handling, storage, and delivery costs.

- **Warehouse Processing Time**: Time taken to pick, pack, and dispatch items from the warehouse.

- **Order Accuracy Rate**: Percentage of orders accurately fulfilled without discrepancies.
  - **Formula**: 
    $$
    \frac{\text{Accurate Orders}}{\text{Total Orders}} \times 100
    $$

- **Inventory Turnover Rate**: Measures how often inventory is replaced over a period.
  - **Formula**: 
    $$
    \frac{\text{Cost of Goods Sold}}{\text{Average Inventory Value}}
    $$

### 4. Logistics and Carrier Performance KPIs

- **Carrier On-Time Performance**: Percentage of shipments delivered on time by each carrier.

- **Average Transit Time by Carrier**: Measures the average time shipments spend in transit per carrier.

- **Shipment Tracking Accuracy**: Rate of accurate updates provided for shipment tracking.

- **Delivery Attempt Rate**: Percentage of deliveries attempted on the first try.

### 5. Data Pipeline Health KPIs

- **Data Ingestion Latency**: Measures the time taken to ingest data from sources (Kinesis, S3, etc.) into the pipeline.

- **Data Processing Time**: Average time for ETL processing and transformation steps.

- **Data Pipeline Success Rate**: Percentage of successful pipeline runs without failures.
  - **Formula**: 
    $$
    \frac{\text{Successful Runs}}{\text{Total Runs}} \times 100
    $$

- **ETL Error Rate**: Number of ETL jobs that failed during the data pipeline process.

## Components

1. **Data Ingestion**
   - **AWS S3**: Used for storing raw data files.
   - **AWS Lambda**: Functions to trigger data ingestion and processing workflows.

2. **Data Storage**
   - **AWS S3**: Raw and processed data storage.
   - **Amazon RDS**: Relational database for structured data storage.

3. **Data Processing**
   - **AWS Glue**: ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) jobs to process and transform data.
   - **AWS Step Functions**: Orchestrates the workflow of data processing tasks.

4. **Data Visualization**
   - **Amazon QuickSight**: Business intelligence and data visualization.

## Prerequisites

- AWS Account
- AWS CLI configured
- IAM roles with necessary permissions
- S3 buckets for raw and processed data
- Amazon RDS instance
- Amazon QuickSight account

## Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/aws-data-engineering-solution.git
   cd aws-data-engineering-solution
   ```

2. **Create S3 Buckets**
   ```bash
   aws s3 mb s3://your-raw-data-bucket
   aws s3 mb s3://your-processed-data-bucket
   ```

3. **Deploy AWS Lambda Functions**
   - Navigate to the `lambda` directory and deploy the functions using AWS CLI or AWS Management Console.

4. **Configure AWS Glue**
   - Create AWS Glue crawlers and jobs to process the data.
   - Define the ETL scripts and schedule the jobs.

5. **Set Up Amazon RDS**
   - Create an RDS instance and configure the database schema.
   - Load initial data into the RDS instance.

6. **Orchestrate with AWS Step Functions**
   - Define the state machine to orchestrate the data processing workflow.
   - Deploy the state machine using AWS CLI or AWS Management Console.

7. **Visualize Data with Amazon QuickSight**
   - Connect Amazon QuickSight to the RDS instance.
   - Create dashboards and visualizations to analyze the processed data.

## Usage

1. **Ingest Data**
   - Upload raw data files to the S3 bucket.
   - AWS Lambda functions will trigger the data processing workflow.

2. **Process Data**
   - AWS Glue jobs will extract, transform, and load the data into the RDS instance.

3. **Visualize Data**
   - Use Amazon QuickSight to create and view dashboards based on the processed data.
